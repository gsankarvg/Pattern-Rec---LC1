question 2: 

In NLP, bigrams and trigrams are types of n-grams, where n represents the number of words grouped together in sequences:
Bigrams: Sequences of two adjacent words in a text.
Trigrams: Sequences of three adjacent words in a text.

string.punctuation: This contains all common punctuation characters like !"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_{|}~`.

Translation table is essentially a mapping that tells the str.translate() method how to transform or replace specific characters in a string.
How to Create a Translation Table:
The str.maketrans(x,y,z) function generates a translation table.
It takes up to three arguments:
x: Characters to be replaced.
y: Characters to replace with.
z: Characters to delete.

steps:
1. read the csv file and store the lines in 'sentences'
2. Combining sentences into a single text and converting to lowercase
3. remove all the punctuations using translation table
4. Splitting the text into words
5. Counter() gives the {words:count} --> Counting word frequencies
6. Generating bigrams and trigrams
7. Counting bigram and trigram frequencies
8. Printing the most common words, bigrams, and trigrams
